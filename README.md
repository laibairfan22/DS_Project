# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms: Kruskal and Prim

**Overview**
This C++ project implements two popular algorithms for finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, undirected graph: Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. These algorithms are essential in network design, ensuring the creation of a tree that spans all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# Features

**Kruskal's Algorithm:**
Efficiently find the minimum spanning tree by sorting edges based on weights and progressively adding edges with the smallest weights, avoiding cycles.

**Prim's Algorithm:**
Build the minimum spanning tree incrementally by starting with an arbitrary vertex and adding the shortest edge at each step, ensuring a connected and acyclic tree.

# How to Run
To run the project, follow these steps:
Compile the code and run source file
_** For prims:**_
 Data set is given in code if you want to change then write manually in array or make following changes in code: take input from user in that array.
 It gives you shortest path

_** For karuskal:**_
Enter data set containing number of edges and vertices of any graph
 It gives you shortest path
